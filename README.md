# Project Oizys
 Project Oizys is a virtual environment developed with Unity that allows users to wander around a hiking trail. Within this environment, users are able to meet others around campfires and have therapy sessions together. The idea of this is to create a safe online environment for those suffering from depression to meet up (anonymously if they choose to) and be able to talk about the issues they face with each other. Project Oizys was created for a school project to create a product targeted at a user group and performing user testing on them. This product would be publicly accessible in private booths at several locations and would only require a screen, controller, and a Kinect.
